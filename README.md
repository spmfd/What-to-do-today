# Day Schedule

## Description

This website was created with the goal of learning how to interact with APIs as well as savings information to local storage. Worked with momentNow website in order to get an accurate clock associated with the website. Also used bootstrap website for easy formatting. 

With the addition of the time variable we are also able to manipulate our backgrounds to indicate if our time slots are past, present, or upcoming in the future. As we learn more and more in this bootcamp it is amazing to see all these free websites that exist to provide coders with resources. Learning how to code given other people's variables is an important skill to learn as there will always be projects where we have to work with other's code or fix previous code. It amazes me how much better I am at reading code from week 1 to now.
